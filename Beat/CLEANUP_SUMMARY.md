# 🧹 Beat App Cleanup Summary

## 🗑️ **Removed Duplicate AppDatabase**

### **Deleted File:**
- ❌ `Beat/app/src/main/java/com/example/beat/data/AppDatabase.java` (Version 3, incomplete)

### **Kept File:**
- ✅ `Beat/app/src/main/java/com/example/beat/data/database/AppDatabase.java` (Version 4, complete with PlaylistDao)

**Reason:** The duplicate database was causing conflicts and the one in the `database` package is more complete and up-to-date.
